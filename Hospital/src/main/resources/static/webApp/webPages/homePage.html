			<h2>This is my first blog post</h2>

				Far <strong>far</strong> away, <strong>behind</strong> the word
				mountains, <em>far</em> from the countries <em>Vokalia</em> and <em>Consonantia</em>,
				there live the <u>blind texts</u>. <br> Separated they live in
				Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language
				ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies
				it with the necessary regelialia.

			<h4>HTML is ok</h4>

			<p class="main-text">A wonderful serenity has taken possession of
				my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy
				with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in
				this spot, which was created for the bliss of souls like mine.</p>

			"!DOCTYPE html" in very begining before html headder. <br>
			<br> "html" encloses whole page. <br>
			<br> "head" un displayed meta data, aka tab of browser. <br>
			<br> "title" is title. <br>
			<br> "body" is main components. <br>
			<br> "p" for paragraph sections. <br>
			<br> "h1...h7" for headders lower number larger headder. <br>
			<br> "br" for line breaks. <br>
			<br> "strong" for bold, "em" for italics, "u" for underline. <br>
			<br> "img src = "file_name" alt = "text if there is an error
			with image"" to place image. <br>
			<br> "a href = "URL" target = "_blank"" <strong>a</strong> for
			anchor (beginning of hypertext link) <strong>href</strong> which
			specifies a location <strong>target </strong> is how it opens the
			page (replaces current page by default) >what to click to go to link
			<!-- < -->
			. Then close "/a". <br>
			<br> "link rel = "stylesheet" type = "test/css" href =
			"style.css"" link our css style to our html file. <br>
			<br> In .css text file <strong>tags</strong> can have their
			styles changes. Examples are font-color: "color", font-familt:: "font
			style", etc. Multiple can be combined eg. h1, h2 { ... }. <br>
			<br> when making tags e.g. "p" for paragraph sections it is good
			practice to name them as a class i.e. "p class= "name_of_class" so
			you can easily manipulate in css file. In css file use
			.name_of_class{ ... }. id can also be used but is bad practice and in
			css file its .name_of_id { ... }. <br>
			<br> use "* { margin: 0; padding: 0; box-sizing: border-box; }"
			to start with a 0 border baseline and then edit the values
			induvidually. <br>
			<br> "div" stands for divde to section out the page into boxes.
			<br>
			<br> "margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" makes both margins
			even with the container size. <br>
			<br> In the div classes width %, float for positioning,
			.clearfix:after {content: ""; display: table;clear: both;} so next
			div box isnt affected by floats. "margins = 20px auto 0 auto;" used
			for spacing. padding also used to space boxes. and "border = 1px
			solid rgb" for lines. <br>
			<br> .author-box img { ... } makes all img inside that div box
			follow that css file style. <br>
			<br> set parent div to relative and a child to absoluto to get
			things where you want them. <br>
			<br> position: absolute; width: 1550px; top: 50%; left: 50%;
			transform: translate(-50%, -50%); to get a box centered. <br>
			<br> background-size: cover; background-position: center;
			height: 100vh; for full background image to cover webpage. <br>
			<br> background-image: linear-gradient(color 1, color 2),
			url(image_destination); to put a "filter" on background. <br>
			<br> inline an element to inline block allows for padding and
			margins, e.g. inline element such as "a" can be changed to an inline
			block. <br>
			<br> btn:link "link" means pre visited, and .btn:visited
			"visited" means clicked. <br>
			<br> .btn:hover and .btn:active for hovered and clicked. <br>
			<br> When making links to go to other sites use "ul" unsorted
			list which is a rel that we downloaded and href to for lists, and
			inside make seperate "li" elements with "a href" elements inside. It
			goes ul>li>a href. <br> Inside cascading lists you use one "ul"
			class name then just type the element after in order to edit the
			element. E.g .main-nav {...} .main-nav li {...} .main-nav li a:link
			{...}. <br>
			<br>
			<!-- Add section element <section class = "class_name"> </section>  -->
			<br>
			<br> div class "col span-x-to-y" uses imported grid to organize
			and space the columns evenly. <br>
			<br> Used icons by importing them with a script right before
			body closing(may be slow).
			<!--  <script src="https://unpkg.com/ionicons@5.2.3/dist/ionicons.js"></script> -->
			<br> You can make a class = "icon-class" when making the icon
			element to use an dedit in .css file later. <br>
			<br> To add a line graphic define it with "element:after", and
			draw it out with attributes such as; <br> display: block; <br>
			height: 2px; <br> background-color: color; <br> content: "
			"; Lets it be visible, if not there the line would not show, when you
			put something the letter apper below <br> width: 100px; <br>
			margin: 0px auto; <br> margin-top: 30px; or margin: 30 auto 0
			auto <br>
			<br> making a paragraph ceneterd and at specific width of page,
			in css .p_class_name {line-height: 145%; width: 70%; margin-left:
			15%; } Left margin is half of remaining width. <br>
